# profesia-fixer
Some features in the system were either illogical or poorly implemented, and there was little interest in fixing them. That's why I created Profesia Fixer â€” a tool designed to resolve these issues effectively. I later enhanced it by integrating AI to further improve accuracy and automation.

## Installation

1. Download (or clone) this repository into your home directory
2. Open Chrome extensions: chrome://extensions/
3. Click to button "Load unpacked" and select extension folder (downloaded in home directory)
(if you want to use AI, you will need OpenAI API and apiKey)
4. Click to your extension "Details" button
5. Click to "Extension settings", enter API key and save settings
6. Login to Profesia.sk, navigate to your CV edit form and enjoy new features :-)
